Make a backup. Make sure that your database is not being updated.

pg_dumpall > outputfile
Install Postgres 10. Follow instructions on this page: https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/ubuntu/

Then run sudo apt-get install postgresql-10. A newer version will be installed side-by-side with the earlier version.

Run pg_lsclusters:

Ver Cluster Port Status Owner    Data directory               Log file
9.6 main    5432 online postgres /var/lib/postgresql/9.6/main /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-9.6-main.log
10  main    5433 online postgres /var/lib/postgresql/10/main  /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-10-main.log
There already is a cluster main for 10 (since this is created by default on package installation). This is done so that a fresh installation works out of the box without the need to create a cluster first, but of course it clashes when you try to upgrade 9.6/main when 10/main also exists. The recommended procedure is to remove the 10 cluster with pg_dropcluster and then upgrade with pg_upgradecluster.

Stop the 10 cluster and drop it:

sudo pg_dropcluster 10 main --stop
Stop all processes and services writing to the database. Stop the database:

sudo systemctl stop postgresql 
Upgrade the 9.6 cluster:

sudo pg_upgradecluster -m upgrade 9.6 main
Run pg_lsclusters. Your 9.6 cluster should now be "down", and the 10 cluster should be online at 5432:

Ver Cluster Port Status Owner    Data directory               Log file
9.6 main    5433 down   postgres /var/lib/postgresql/9.6/main /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-9.6-main.log
10  main    5432 online postgres /var/lib/postgresql/10/main  /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-10-main.log
First, check that everything works fine. After that, remove the 9.5 cluster:

 sudo pg_dropcluster 9.6 main --stop
